cx_Freeze and PyInstaller
cx_Freeze and PyInstaller are two popular Python libraries that allow you to create standalone executable files from your Python scripts. Both libraries package your Python code and any required dependencies into a single file, making it easy to distribute and run your program on other computers without needing to install Python or any other dependencies.

cx_Freeze is a cross-platform library that can create executables for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It works by freezing your Python script into a binary file that can be run as an executable. cx_Freeze supports a wide range of Python modules and extensions, and can be configured to include additional data files and resources.

PyInstaller is another popular library for creating standalone executables from Python scripts. It supports Windows, Linux, and macOS, and can package your Python script and its dependencies into a single executable file. PyInstaller can handle most Python packages and modules, and can also include additional data files and resources in the final executable.

Both cx_Freeze and PyInstaller offer a range of configuration options to customize the build process, including options for specifying which modules and files to include, setting file paths and directories, and more. They are both open-source libraries with active development and support communities, making them a reliable choice for creating standalone executable files from Python scripts.

In this repository, you'll find examples of how to use both cx_Freeze and PyInstaller to create standalone executables from your Python scripts. Each example includes a setup.py file with the necessary configuration options, as well as any additional files and resources required by the script. You can use these examples as a starting point for creating your own standalone executables using either library.
