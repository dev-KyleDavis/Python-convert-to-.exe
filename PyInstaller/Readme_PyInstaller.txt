Here are the general steps to use this code to create an executable file from a Python script using PyInstaller:

Install PyInstaller. PyInstaller is a third-party library that allows you to convert Python scripts into standalone executable files. 
If you haven't installed PyInstaller yet, you can do so by opening the command prompt and running the following command:

Copy code
pip install pyinstaller
Create a Python script that you want to convert into an executable file. This script should contain the main functionality of your program.

Copy the code you provided into a new Python file called build.py. This code sets up the configuration for the executable file.

Replace the following parameters in the Analysis() and EXE() functions with the appropriate values for your program:

['name of python program here']: Replace this with the name of the Python script that you want to convert into an executable file.
name='Name your folder here': Replace 'Name your folder here' with the name that you want to give to the folder that will contain the final executable file.
Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where your build.py and Python script files are located.

Run the following command in the command prompt to build the executable file:

Copy code
python build.py
This will create a new directory called dist within your project directory. Inside the dist directory, you'll find a folder with the name you specified in name='Name your folder here'. 
Inside this folder, you'll find the final executable file for your program.

Test your executable file to ensure that it works properly. Double-click on the executable file to run your program. If it runs without any errors, you're all set!

Note that the process of creating an executable file can be more complex depending on the specific requirements of your program, such as including additional data files, dependencies, or other resources. 
You may need to modify the build.py file accordingly to ensure that all necessary files and resources are included in the final executable file.
