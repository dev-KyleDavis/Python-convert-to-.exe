These options will make your Python programs convert to .exe

Cx_freeze:
Here are the general steps to use this code to create an executable file from a Python script:

Install cx_Freeze. cx_Freeze is a third-party library that allows you to convert Python scripts into standalone executable files. If you haven't installed cx_Freeze yet, you can do so by opening the command prompt and running the following command:


pip install cx_Freeze

Create a Python script that you want to convert into an executable file. This script should contain the main functionality of your program.

Copy the code you provided into a new Python file called setup.py. This code sets up the configuration for the executable file.

Replace the following parameters in the setup() function with the appropriate values for your program:

name: The name of your program.
version: The version number of your program.
description: A brief description of your program.
executables: A list of executables to be created from your Python file.
In the executables list, replace python file name here.py with the name of the Python script that you want to convert into an executable file. If your Python file is located in a different directory, you'll need to provide the full path to that file instead.

Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where your setup.py and Python script files are located.

Run the following command in the command prompt to build the executable file:


python setup.py build

This will create a new directory called build within your project directory. Inside the build directory, you'll find the executable file for your program.

Test your executable file to ensure that it works properly. Double-click on the executable file to run your program. If it runs without any errors, you're all set!

Note that the process of creating an executable file can be more complex depending on the specific requirements of your program, such as including additional data files, dependencies, or other resources. You may need to modify the setup.py file accordingly to ensure that all necessary files and resources are included in the final executable file.
